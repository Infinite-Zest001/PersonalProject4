### Versioning :
| CommitVer:    | Meaning                                            |  
| ------------- |:--------------------------------------------------:|
| SB            | Stable-Build: Stable/Working-release for Public use| 
| F             | Feature: New feature/bug fix                       |
| M             | Minor: Code refactor or readme change              |  

#### NOTE:
- Commit Version messages can combine the syntax of SB, F, and M (i.e. *CommitVer SB_F_M*, *CommitVer F_M*, *CommitVer SB_M*)
- Builds that do not have SB (i.e. *CommitVer F*, *CommitVer M*, *CommitVer F_M* or *M_F*)
**DO NOT** work and **SHOULD NOT** be used by end users.
